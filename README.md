A workadventure map of our office, so we can finally queue up at a real virtual coffee machine.

## Contributing

__When working on the map, make sure you're the only one working at specific layer/tileset, as merging the changes on a single layer is hard.__

Join the #workadventrue channel to coordinate. Still need help on:

* Creating issues for coordinating work
* Hosting our own instance
* Adding details and features to the map
* Looking for good tile sets
* Creating own tiles
